## Getting Started
First if you don't have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) you should download it for using NPM. 
Then go into your IDE and open terminal.
Run thÄ±s commands:
``` bash
# Install dependencies (only the first time)
npm install

# Run the local server at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# Build for production in the dist/ directory
npm run build
```
